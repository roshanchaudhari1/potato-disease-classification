# Chapter 3: Research Methodology

## 3.1 Research Design

This research employs an applied research methodology with a quantitative approach to develop a deep learning-based system for potato leaf disease classification. The study follows an experimental design to systematically evaluate the performance of various convolutional neural network architectures in classifying potato leaf diseases.

The research process is structured in sequential phases:
1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Gathering and preprocessing potato leaf images
2. **Model Development**: Designing and training CNN models
3. **Performance Evaluation**: Testing and comparing model performance
4. **Application Development**: Creating a user-friendly interface
5. **Validation**: Field testing with actual potato leaf samples

## 3.2 Data Collection

### 3.2.1 Data Sources

The dataset for this study was collected from multiple sources to ensure diversity and robustness:

1. **PlantVillage Dataset**: A public repository containing 2,152 labeled images of potato leaves categorized as:
   - Healthy (152 images)
   - Early Blight (1,000 images)
   - Late Blight (1,000 images)

2. **Field Collection**: 300 additional images collected from potato farms in agricultural regions, using a structured sampling approach to ensure representation across:
   - Different growth stages of potato plants
   - Various lighting conditions
   - Different severity levels of disease
   - Multiple potato varieties

3. **Augmented Data**: Generated through image transformations to increase dataset size and diversity

### 3.2.2 Data Collection Tools

The following tools were employed for data collection:
- Digital cameras (Canon EOS 750D) with 24MP resolution
- Smartphone cameras (iPhone 12, Samsung Galaxy S21) with 12MP resolution
- Portable light boxes for controlled lighting conditions
- GPS devices for location tagging
- Field notebooks for recording environmental conditions

### 3.2.3 Sampling Strategy

A stratified random sampling technique was implemented to ensure:
- Adequate representation of each disease category
- Diversity in leaf positions (top, middle, bottom)
- Variation in disease severity (early stage, intermediate, advanced)
- Collection across different times of day (morning, noon, evening)

## 3.3 Data Preprocessing

### 3.3.1 Image Preprocessing Pipeline

All collected images underwent a standardized preprocessing workflow:

1. **Resizing**: All images standardized to 224×224 pixels to ensure uniform input dimension for the neural networks
2. **Normalization**: Pixel values normalized to the range [0,1] by dividing by 255
3. **Augmentation**: Generation of additional training samples through:
   - Random rotations (0-30 degrees)
   - Horizontal and vertical flips
   - Brightness variations (±10%)
   - Zoom variations (±15%)
   - Shear transformations (±10 degrees)

### 3.3.2 Data Splitting

The dataset was partitioned as follows:
- Training set: 70% (for model learning)
- Validation set: 15% (for hyperparameter tuning)
- Test set: 15% (for final evaluation)

The splitting preserved the class distribution to maintain representation across all partitions.
